DESCRIPTION
    Welcome to MinionEscape! In this game, you are a minion who has been captured by the evil villain, El Macho. At the beginning of the game,
    you are locked in the dungeon of El Macho's mansion, and you have to make your way through several obstacles and rooms in order to escape
    through the front door. Among these obstacles are fights that you need to win (with the help of weapons you pick up) and items to obtain
    in order to continue on; if you do not succeed or follow the right path, then your minion will be locked up, and you are forced to restart.
    Good luck and enjoy the game!


STEP-BY-STEP DESCRIPTION
1- The main character, whichever the minion the user chooses is, is stuck in a cage in the dungeon of El Macho.
He needs to escape by finding a key, opening the cell, freezing a purple minion guard, going up the stairs, opening the dining room door,
defeating a group of evil minions, and finally tasing El Macho.

2- First, the user needs to choose a box to open: box 1 or box 2, and he will keep trying until he chooses box 2, which contains a key.

3- Using the key, he would open the door and onto the dungeon floor, then be prompted to choose among 3 items to keep. There is only one option
that would help him, which is the Freeze Ray, and he would use the Freeze Ray to freeze the minion. Before actually fighting the minion,
there is a question that will ask if you want to use your freeze ray or not, and if not, then your minion will be knocked out with a blow,
and the user will have to start all over. If the freeze ray if used, the user will have to type 'shoot' within 5 seconds, otherwise you will be locked up again.

5- After you defeat the first minion, you may choose to take his crowbar or not. You need to use the crowbar later, but can also retrieve
it later too.

6- Once you ascend up the stairs, you enter the dining room of El Macho's mansion and discover that the door to the foyer is jammed...so you
need to use a crowbar! If you don't have a crowbar, you can choose to go back (within 5 seconds) or be forced to stay there until another
minion comes and captures you.

7- If you have a crowbar, you can pry open the door and into the foyer. After observing the surroundings, you will find a jelly gun and use that
to convert a swarm of purple minions back into normal minions again. This function will prompt the user to type 'shoot' consecutively.

8- Once that is over, you will have another option to pick up a red lipstick taser...it is clever to keep it, for it will help with El Macho
(you will need to take it).

9- Your minion heads for the door but is blocked by El Macho himself, and he is at 100% health. Your lipstick taser can only administer 25%
damage, so the user is asked how many times to tase El Macho. Once you answer '4' correctly, you will have to 'tase' El Macho four times, all
within 5 seconds, and then you are free! If you do not meet the 5 seconds, you will be caught and sent back to prison to start over.

10- If you completed all these stages, you are free! The minion has finally escaped.
